# Deep Learning Models for Sea Temperature Forecasting 
## Contributors: Bennett Blanco, Jenn Hong, Setu Shah

Rising sea temperatures are a key modern challenge, especially for local fisheries and the
agriculture industry, which rely on delicate ecosystems linked to localized sea temperatures. As
global warming changes microclimate patterns, effective temperature prediction tools are crucial
to helping farmers stay prepared. Yet, historical sea climate data encompasses many variables at
a large scale, challenging traditional regression analysis. By leveraging the power of neural
networks, the full magnitude of data can be used to make accurate predictions. These predictions
will help fisheries’ operations planning and knowledge of fish supply trends. Neural network models
thus help inform decision-making, contributing to the sustainability of vital industries.
